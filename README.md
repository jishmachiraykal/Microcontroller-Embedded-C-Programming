## Welcome to Microcontroller Embedded C Programming
### This repo contains some of the critical microcontroller-related 'C' concepts and code such as

  * Importance of bitwise operators

  * Usage of bit manipulation techniques to program MCU peripheral registers

  * Accessing memory-mapped registers using pointers

   * Pointers and casting

   * Structures, bitfields, unions, and bit extraction techniques

   * Representing hardware registers details and configuring them using 'C' structure definitions

   * Usage of const and volatile type qualifiers

   * Interpret complex variable definitions involving the combination of const and volatile

   * The precise usage of const pointers, const data, volatile const, with pointer and non-pointer variables

   * The behavior of the code during compiler optimization and solution using volatile

   * Functions and friends

   * Data types, variables definitions, storage class specifiers and much more

   * Loops: while, for, do. while

   * MCU internal architecture and programming peripherals

   * Interfacing projects
