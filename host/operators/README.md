* Parentheses(), to be used to force an expression to a higher precedence. So use ()  if you want to promote promote precedence of an operator of our choice

* All arithmetic operators are binary operators i.e., at least they need 2 operands to operate
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus

* Precedence table, lower the number higher the precedence

* x=x+1 equivalent of this to unary operator is x++. x++ and ++x both are same

* Relational operators are evaluated from left to right and it is a binary operator

* = assignment operator and == equal to operator. Relational operators are evaluational operators.
In C, 0 is false and anything non-zero is true

* 3 logical operators: AND, OR and NOT(unary)

* 1 && 10 = true because both 1 and 10 are non-zero values/
0 && 1 = false because 0 is false and FT is false
