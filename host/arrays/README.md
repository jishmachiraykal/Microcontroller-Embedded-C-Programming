* An array in C is a collection of data of the same datatype

* Syntax: uint8_t studentsAge[100];
Here studentsAge is a reference or an array variable or a pointer. Hence data type of studentsAge is uint8_t* and not uint8_t and data type of items stored in uint8_t

* Data item will be stored in contiguous memory location in the memory which means if we know the base address of the array, then we can manipulate any data in the memory
