* Syntax: scanf("%d", &age);

* Scanf reads the integer which user enters(%d) and puts that read value "at the address of" 'age' variable(&age) and not the ascii value. In order to store the ascii value of age entered give %c

* If you give more input than asked then scanf will only take the no. of inputs which asked not more than that
